# Clinical Data Warehouse UI  
**HI 741 Final Project**

This project is a Python-based desktop GUI application built with **Tkinter**, designed to facilitate interaction with clinical patient data. It supports different types of users (like clinicians, nurses, admins, and managers) by offering a **role-based login system** and tools to manage and analyze medical records stored in CSV files.

---

## Main Features

### Login & Roles
- User login credentials are stored in `data/Credentials.csv`
- Access is tailored by role: clinician, nurse, administrator, or management
- All login attempts, successful or not, are recorded for security tracking

### Patient Management & Analytics
- **View Patient Info**: Display the most recent visit details
- **Add New Patient**: Input patient details and create a new entry
- **Remove Patient**: Erase a patient and their data using their ID
- **Visit Counts by Date**: Calculate how many visits occurred on a chosen date
- **Read Clinical Notes**: Show visit-specific notes per patient and date
- **Race Distribution Chart**: Generate a bar graph showing demographic stats

### Logs & Outputs
- Logs are stored in `output/usage_log.csv`
- Any updates to patient records are saved in `output/updated_patient_data.csv`
- Generated charts are saved as `output/statistics_plot.png`

### How to Run

1. Set up the environment

   Open a terminal and install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure the following directories and CSV files exist:
```
- `data/Credentials.csv`
- `data/Patient_data.csv`
- `data/Notes.csv`
- Create an empty `output/` directory if it doesn’t exist
```
3. Run the application

From the root directory of the project, run:
```
python src/main.py
```
### Requirements

Install the dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Major Dependencies

```
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
- `numpy`
- `pillow`
- `csv`
- `os`, `datetime`, `random`, `re` (standard Python libraries)
```
### Developer Notes

- The project follows a modular design using object-oriented programming principles.
- Key classes include: `User`, `Patient`, `Visit`, `PatientRecordManager`, `HealthProfessional`, `Manager`, `Validator`, `Admin`, and `App` (GUI controller in `ui.py`).
- Logic is cleanly separated into modules to enhance readability, maintainability, and future extensibility.
- GUI and backend logic are decoupled, making it easier to add new features or update existing ones.
- Each user action is handled with appropriate error handling to provide user feedback and ensure robust logging.
